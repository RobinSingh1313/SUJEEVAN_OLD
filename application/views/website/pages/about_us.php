                        <h3>Our Story</h3>

                        <p>
                            Fight Fat Health and Wellness Services PVT Ltd was founded in the year 2020 by two brothers
                            Bharath Atthe and Dr. Bhageerath Atthe (MD, DM Cardiology). At a very young age, they lost
                            their dad in a road accident, his dad could have saved if there were proper health care
                            facilities near the rural area where the incident has happened. That tragedy in their life
                            changed everything for them, it was always in their mind that when they grow up they want to
                            be healthcare professionals and change how the healthcare system is delivered in India.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Bharath Atthe after finishing his undergrad in Biomedical Engineering (BME) in 2006 with his
                            quest for research, development, and innovation in healthcare, started his research journey
                            in Singapore as an Intern and went to the USA to pursue his Master’s and Ph.D. in BME at one
                            of the most renowned Universities for BME in the country. Bharath has published several
                            research papers in the field of NanoEngineering, Tissue Engineering, Non-invasive monitoring
                            of diseases in the Kidney, Heart, and Brain using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
                            techniques, also presented his research work at scientific conferences across the USA and
                            Canada. During his stint as a Research Scientist and a Data Scientist, his work was focused
                            on early detection of diseases, clinical trials on finding the efficacy of a drug on
                            Multiple Sclerosis patients, prediction of certain diseases based on the risk parameters of
                            patients using machine learning & Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.

                            Even though Bharath was working on cutting-edge research and state of the art technologies
                            in healthcare, he always wanted to go back to India and work on the healthcare system at the
                            grass-root level. In 2017, while he was just browsing through a scientific journal he
                            happened to see an article which is on “reversing diabetes with food and exercise”. Bharath
                            got fascinated with this idea of reversing or managing the diseases and had extensive
                            discussions with his younger brother Dr. Bhageerath who was pursuing his
                            super-specialization in Cardiology at Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Bhageerath who is a Cardiologist by profession and Entrepreneur at Heart had some
                            wonderful ideas about bringing lifestyle changes in people which happens to be the leading
                            cause for cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions. Bharath and his brother
                            after having several brainstorming sessions over the phone decided to establish a Health and
                            Wellness Centre in Hyderabad, India.</p>
                        <p>
                            It’s a dream come true for these two brothers as Fight Fat Health and Wellness Services Pvt
                            Ltd now offers several healthcare services that truly help their clients get a solution to
                            any health issue in an integrated and holistic manner.
