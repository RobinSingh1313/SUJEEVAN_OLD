                            Even though Bharath was working on cutting-edge research and state of the art technologies
                            in healthcare, he always wanted to go back to India and work on the healthcare system at the
                            grass-root level. In 2017, while he was just browsing through a scientific journal he
                            happened to see an article which is on “reversing diabetes with food and exercise”. Bharath
                            got fascinated with this idea of reversing or managing the diseases and had extensive
                            discussions with his younger brother Dr. Bhageerath who was pursuing his
                            super-specialization in Cardiology at Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Bhageerath who is a Cardiologist by profession and Entrepreneur at Heart had some
                            wonderful ideas about bringing lifestyle changes in people which happens to be the leading
                            cause for cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions. Bharath and his brother
                            after having several brainstorming sessions over the phone decided to establish a Health and
                            Wellness Centre in Hyderabad, India.</p>
                        <p>
                            It’s a dream come true for these two brothers as Fight Fat Health and Wellness Services Pvt
                            Ltd now offers several healthcare services that truly help their clients get a solution to
